This list is a To-Do list for the developers:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implement a Database instead of manually dragging in pictures and manually
creating .txt documents for the browse.php page.

Create a Sign in page
	You are able to log in as a customer or the owner. Since there will be no
	employees we don't need anything for them.

Create a purchase page so when the user clicks purchase on a painting they're 
redirected to a purchase page
